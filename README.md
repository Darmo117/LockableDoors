This is a [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod.

# How to Use

To craft a lockable block, simply put the corresponding vanilla block and a lock housing in a crafting table.

To install a lock on a block, simply right-click on the block with a keyed lock in your hand. The lock remover must be used to remove a lock from a lockable block.

When a block is equipped with a lock, you can lock/unlock it with the corresponding key by right-clicking. A locked block cannot be opened by hand nor redstone signals.

When you craft a key or lock, it is blank and cannot be used yet. In order to make them usable, they need to be machined using the locksmithing station. Simply input the key’s/lock’s name in the top field then pick the item from the output slot. The key’s name appears in its tooltip but locks simply show the word “Keyed” in green. You can check if a key fits in a lock without mounting it on a block, put each one in each hand and right-click.

***Notice: Keys cannot be renamed!***

Keys can be melted back to a single iron nugget in a furnace/blast furnace.
